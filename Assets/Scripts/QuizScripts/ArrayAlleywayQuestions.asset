  questions:
  - questionText: What is an Array?
    answers:
    - A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
    - A function in a programming language.
    - A type of loop in programming.
    - A way to store variables in HTML.
    correctAnswerIndex: 0
    answerInfo:
    - This is the accurate definition of an array. An array is a data structure consisting
      of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or
      key. The elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, which allows for
      efficient access to the elements.
    - This is not a correct definition of an array. A function is a different concept
      in programming; it is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
      Arrays and functions are fundamentally different constructs in programming.
    - This statement is not correct. A loop is a programming construct that repeats
      a block of code multiple times, but an array is a data structure used to store
      multiple values. While loops can be used to iterate over arrays, they are not
      the same thing.
    - This option is not correct. HTML is a markup language used for creating and
      structuring content on the web. It does not have a direct method for storing
      variables like an array. Arrays are typically used in programming languages
      like JavaScript, which can interact with HTML, but they are not a feature of
      HTML itself.
  - questionText: How can you access the Burger element you placed into the array
      into the TrashArray?
    answers:
    - By calling the array's name only.
    - TrashArray[6] (Using its index number.)
    - TrashArray[5] (Using its index number.)
    - Arrays cannot have individual elements accessed.
    correctAnswerIndex: 2
    answerInfo:
    - Simply calling the array's name will not access a specific element within the
      array. This action typically returns the entire array or its properties, not
      an individual element.
    - If "Burger" is indeed the seventh element in the array (with the first element
      at index 0), then TrashArray[6] correctly accesses it. In zero-based indexing,
      which is common in many programming languages, the index of an array element
      is one less than its position number in the array.
    - If the "Burger" element is in the slot labeled as 5, then it is at index 5.
      In zero-based indexing, you would access this element with TrashArray[5].
    - This is a repetition of the first option and is still incorrect for the same
      reasons. Simply calling the array's name won't retrieve a specific element
      from the array.
  - questionText: What is a characteristic of an array in most programming languages?
    answers:
    - All elements must be of different data types.
    - The size of the array can be changed dynamically.
    - Elements are stored in random memory locations.
    - All elements in the array must be of the same data type.
    correctAnswerIndex: 3
    answerInfo:
    - This isn't right. Think of an array like a tray of eggs. All the eggs (elements)
      are of the same kind; in the same way, an array is usually made to hold items
      that are all of the same type.
    - This isn't usually the case. When you first create an array, it's like deciding
      how many eggs your tray can hold. Once you decide, you can't change it without
      creating a new tray. Some special arrays are more like magic trays that can
      grow or shrink, but the basic ones can't do this.
    - Nope, that's not how it works. Arrays keep all their items in a neat line in
      memory, kind of like how books are kept in a row on a shelf. This makes it
      really easy to find an item because you know exactly where each one is placed.
    - Yes, that's correct! Just like how a carton is made for eggs only and not for
      mixing eggs with apples, an array is made to store items that are all the same
      type. This makes sure that the space in memory is used well and everything
      stays organized.
